    <h3>This creamy garlic parmesan chicken is a decadent yet simple dish perfect for weeknight dinners or special occasions. Juicy chicken breasts are seared to perfection, then smothered in a creamy garlic parmesan sauce with hints of herbs and topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts and cook until golden brown on each side and no longer pink in the center, about 6-7 minutes per side. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute, until fragrant. Pour in chicken broth and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Allow the broth to simmer and reduce by half, about 5 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Reduce heat to medium-low. Stir in heavy cream, parmesan cheese, dried thyme, and dried oregano. Simmer for 3-4 minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly. Return chicken breasts to the skillet and simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes, until chicken is heated through and sauce is creamy.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Garnish with freshly chopped parsley and serve hot over cooked pasta, rice, or with your favorite vegetables.</p>
